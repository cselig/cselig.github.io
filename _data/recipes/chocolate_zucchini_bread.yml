ingredients:
  - 1 cup all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
  - 2 large eggs at room temperature
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled
  - 1/4 cup canola vegetable oil, or melted coconut oil
  - 3/4 cup  packed light brown sugar
  - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
  - 1 1/2 cups packed shredded zucchini
  - 1 cup  semisweet chocolate chips divided
instructions:
  - Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.
  - In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Set aside.
  - In a large bowl, add the eggs, melted butter, oil, vanilla extract, and brown sugar. Stir until smooth. You might have a few small brown sugar clumps and that is fine.
  - Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, don’t overmix. Stir in the shredded zucchini until just combined. Stir in 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips.
  - Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of chocolate chips over the top of the bread. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out mostly clean, you might have some melted chocolate chips on the toothpick and that is fine. You just don’t want a lot of gooey batter.
  - Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack. Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the bread and carefully remove from the pan. Let the bread cool on the wire cooling rack until slightly warm. Cut into slices and serve.
  - Note-if you use coconut oil, make sure it is melted and slightly cooled. The bread will keep on the counter, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 4 days. This bread also freezes well. To freeze, cool the bread completely and wrap in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost before slicing.
