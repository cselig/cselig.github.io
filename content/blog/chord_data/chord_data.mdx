import ChordPicker from "./chord_picker"

Whenever I listen to music I like trying to identify chord progressions and find common (or uncommon) patterns and changes.
I recently came across the [McGill Billboard dataset](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/The_McGill_Billboard_Project_(Chord_Analysis_Dataset)/),
which is a set of Billboard Top 40 songs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s annotated with structure and chord information. This led me to build
a little widget for creating 4-chord progressions.

## Chord Bigrams

The chord picker is based on chord bigrams, which are just pairs of chords that appear one after the other in a song. For example, if I have this 4-chord
progression:

**1maj** -> **5maj** -> **6min** -> **4maj**

Then I can extract the following three chord bigrams:
- **1maj** -> **5maj**
- **5maj** -> **6min**
- **6min** -> **4maj**

If this progression repeated there would also be the **4maj** -> **1maj** bigram.

## Counting Bigrams

In the widget, chords are sorted by the frequency of the chord bigram with that chord and the previous one. So if I chose **1maj** as my
first chord, the list of possibilities for chord 2 would be sorted based on how often a chord is observed to come after **1maj** in the dataset.
(This is true for all but the first chord, where a small set of "seed" chords are listed.)

This means if you're picking chords at the top of the list, your progression will sound more normal/conventional/diatonic. If you're picking chords
near the bottom of the list your progression could sound more distinctive, but it could also sound more disjointed or nonsensical.

If you don't have a great ear for chord progressions I suggest first plugging the progression above (which appears in [quite a few songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTYrkOZ5nCs))
into the widget below, hearing how it sounds, and then trying to modify it.
