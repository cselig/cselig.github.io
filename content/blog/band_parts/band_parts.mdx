I often think about song structure visually, and this is my first attempt at a such a notation tool.
Instruments are along the Y-axis and on the X-axis are the sections of the song. Color distinguishes
different musical material.

Below are notated a [song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4FAxHgFeG23Igvx8jvBUtB?si=e99611e92deb4768)
from King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard along with an unrelased Lamps original, Ridealong.

And here is the tool.
