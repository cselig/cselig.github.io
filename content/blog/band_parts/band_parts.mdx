I often think about song structure visually, and this is my first attempt at a such a notation tool.
Instruments are along the Y-axis and on the X-axis are the sections of the song. Color distinguishes
different musical material: different colors are different themes, and shades represent
variations.

Below are notated one of my current favorite [songs](https://open.spotify.com/track/4FAxHgFeG23Igvx8jvBUtB?si=e99611e92deb4768)
along with an unrelased Lamps original, Ridealong.

And here is the tool.
