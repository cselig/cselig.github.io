import Pipes from "./pipes"

I came across a GIF of the old "pipes" screensaver from Windows '95 and thought it would be fun to make.
It ended up being a fun challenge, and involved implementing some vector math. I haven't yet gotten around
to the hardest part though, which is making sure the pipes don't intersect themselves.
