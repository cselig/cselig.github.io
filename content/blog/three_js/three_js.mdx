import Pipes from "./pipes"

I came across a GIF of the old "pipes" screensaver from Windows '95 and thought it would be fun to recreate using [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
It ended up being a fun challenge! I haven't yet gotten around
to the hardest part though, which is making sure the pipes don't intersect themselves.
You can check out the completed code [here](https://github.com/cselig/cselig.github.io/blob/develop/content/blog/three_js/pipes.jsx).
