Heirarchical categories are a common data type to encouter on the web. For example on a
jobs posting website you often see options for searching by job
category and location.

Often the relevance of search results to a user follows the structure of these categories.
I might be particularly keen on UX engineering positions, but I also might be
interested in UX design or research which are neighboring categories in the job type
heirarchy. On the other hand I'm probably not at all interested in marketing positions,
a distant category in the job type heirarchy.

Usually these fields are represented by drop-down menus, which do not reflect the
nested structure of the values.
An alternate representation I thought of is a series of stacked chips.

<Sketch scale={1.5} />

Here's an implementation of a set of filters using this representation. Imagine below
the filters a list of results that updates as you change the filter values.

<Component />

Now remember the user from above.
As a second example imagine a user lives in Berlin and would like to find a new job there,
but is open to relocacting within Germany.
I think this system allows both these users to browse results for their preferences more
efficiently and intuitively than a flat drop-down would.
