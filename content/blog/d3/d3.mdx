I'm using some of my "shelter in place" free time to learn D3 and create some toy visualizations.
See complete code [here](https://github.com/cselig/cselig.github.io/tree/develop/content/blog/d3).

### Some sort of bubble chart

I'm not sure what this chart would be called, but something like this could be used for visualizing a single variable.

<BubbleChart />

### Volume Calendar

My take on a nice Strava visualization that shows how much you ran/biked/swam on given days over the past month, along with a weekly aggregation.
The original version displays the calendar day on hover, which I think could be easy to confuse with distance ran on that day.

### Sunburst Chart

This chart (in conjunction with some informative text/tooltips) could be used to visualize data that breaks up into two sets of hierarchical categories.

### Edit Distance

I thought it would be cool to visualize the shortest edit distance between two words with the below animation.
However, it isn't completely correct - the key function I'm
providing to `.data()` is just the letter itself, which means that repeat letters
aren't keyed properly. In theory I could write a more sophisticated key function, which I might get around to but
sounds tricky.

Type a new word or phrase and hit "Update".

<EditDistance />

### Tech Viz

A cool way of displaying technologies I've worked with, with the detail that a technology can be in multiple categories.
I was going to put this on the home page of this blog but it felt a little try-hard.
