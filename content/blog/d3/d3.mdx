I'm using some of my "shelter in place" free time to learn D3 and create some toy visualizations.

### Some sort of bubble chart

I'm not sure what this chart would be called, but something like this could be used for visualizing a single variable.

<BubbleChart />

<ExpandableCodeBlock filePath="d3/bubble_chart.jsx" />

### Volume Calendar

My take on a nice Strava visualization that shows how much you ran/biked/swam on given days over the past month, along with a weekly aggregation.
The original version displays the calendar day on hover, which I think could be easy to confuse with distance ran on that day.

<VolumeCalendar />

<ExpandableCodeBlock filePath="d3/volume_calendar.jsx" />

### Sunburst Chart

This chart (in conjunction with some informative text/tooltips) could be used to visualize data that breaks up into two sets of hierarchical categories.

<SunburstChart />

<ExpandableCodeBlock filePath="d3/sunburst_chart.jsx" />

### Edit Distance

I thought it would be cool to visualize the shortest edit distance between two words with the below animation.
However, the way that D3 does updates and object constancy doesn't make this easy. The key function I'm
providing to `.data()` is just the letter itself, which means that repeat letters
aren't keyed properly. I'd have to write a more sophisticated key function that was basically the Levenshtein
distance algorithm to handle all cases, which I might get around to but sounds hard.

Type a new word or phrase and hit "Update".

<EditDistance />

<ExpandableCodeBlock filePath="d3/edit_distance.jsx" />

### Tech Viz

A cool way of displaying technologies I've worked with, with the detail that a technology can be in multiple categories.
I was going to put this on the home page of this blog but it felt a little try-hard.
