title: Social Media Bad >:(

excerpt: The thought process behind why I recently gave up on social media apps.
---

A few Sundays ago I was sitting at my desk and thinking about all the things I wanted to do in the coming week.
The list included: trying out a new recipe, brainstorming and recording new song ideas for my band, fiddling around with my personal website,
finishing a book that I had been halfway through for 3 months, etc. I wasn't guilt tripping myself into being productive; rather, I was looking
forward to every item on my list because they were all things I really enjoyed doing and find fulfilling.
Then I had a realization: this list sounded a lot like the list I had made the previous Sunday. And in the week between I hadn't
really done anything that I intended (and definitely not for a lack of free time). So over the next week I decided to take better
stock of what I was filling my days with and noticed that a lot of my time was going toward one activity that I hadn't planned at all
and didn't find especially enjoyable: browsing social media.

I want to pause and say that for me, social media (and the time it takes up in most people's day) feels like a touchy subject to write about. I say that because when I myself
read articles about quitting social media I usually come away feeling annoyed or condescended upon. This goes for [blog posts](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amedium.com+social+media+quitting+for+days)
titled something like "What I Learned From Quitting Social Media for N Days" where the author goes cold turkey and transforms themselves (for N days) into a being
of pure self-control and time management skills, or articles from more established news sources that harangue the reader on why social media apps are just terrible
for your mental health/productivity/friendships/etc.

One problem I have with these articles (especially in the latter category) is that the language used is very often negatively charged and filled with judgement.
For example, I did a quick google search and came up with the following headlines:
- [Has social media become an endless nightmare?](https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/opinion/has-social-media-become-endless-nightmare-matt-mohan-hickson-2912439)
- [Doomscrolling Is Slowly Eroding Your Mental Health](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/)
- [Scrolling Is The New Smoking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianatsai/2020/06/25/scrolling-is-the-new-smoking/#6f6168a233ca)

While I actually don't really object to most of the arguments made in the above articles, I think when people see
a headline like the above it immediately gives them the opportunity to dismiss the author as alarmist, out of touch, or nagging.
Even articles that assume a more neutral position often use charged language that implies social media is necessarily
bad and using it is necessarily unproductive, without the author even having to address or argue for those assumptions.

I say all this because I want to avoid these issues when I talk about my own hangups with social media.
One of these hangups is that I felt emotionally drained by my use of social media. Browsing different feeds would leave me
with different figurative sour tastes in my mouth; this was definitely making me more unhappy, even before I was able to articulate exactly why.

My use of social media was also very often distracting me from other tasks that required long periods of focus. This hurt my productivity
but it also hurt my enjoyment of my work and hobbies; I've noticed that the times I'm deeply focused on an activity is usually when I feel
the most enjoyment and fulfillment from that activity.

But the main reason I decided to make a change goes back to me sitting in my room on a Sunday taking stock of what I had done in the past week and what I
intended to do in the next, and realizing that their was a large gulf between the two. **I wasn't finding time in my days to do things I enjoyed, and I decided that
using twitter/reddit/facebook/etc. was the cause.** I could choose to fill my free time with things I actively enjoy, find fulfilling, and that broaden my thinking
and my skills, or I could choose not to.

From there it was a simple decision to change how I used social media in order to make time for things I enjoyed. This took some reflecting on my
own personal access patterns. For example, I was really only in the habit of checking things on my phone (and not on my laptop), so deleting
a few mobile apps was sufficient to remove that temptation.

Of course trying **not** to do something is a lot harder than trying **to** do something, so I decided to focus more
on how I wanted to fill my time and less on avoiding browsing social media. There's an idea I had gotten from  Cal Newport's book Deep Work that I found useful
in scheduling my time: a human's daily capacity for deep focus and doing "hard" things is finite. For example, if I finished a full day of focused work,
immediately studied chess for 2 hours, and then spent the evening practicing cello, I would probably burn out pretty quickly. Not that any of these
are things I shouldn't use my time on, but I should in that case try to structure and schedule my activities in a smarter way.
For me, two activities I decided I want to do more of were reading and cooking. These form a relaxing compliment to my day job, and I have no problem
sitting on the couch and reading for an hour right after I finish my work day.

I do believe that social media can be used productively - this is all based on my own habits of use with these sites. I had a conversation with a friend who
uses reddit in a much different way than I did: he sticks to smaller, interest-based subreddits where he's more likely to see novel content and less likely to get
emotionally burned out. I view this as an enriching and rewarding way to use reddit, and something I would consider in the future.
I also value checking facebook every once in a while. I have a large network of friends there that isn't captured anywhere else, and it's nice for me to stay
somewhat up to date with big events in people's lives.

I also recognize the irony and privilege in talking about turning away from social media when we're living through events
that we can't and shouldn't turn away from â€“ but I'll leave it up to you to determine if your social media feeds
leave you better informed and prepared to take positive action or just emotionally exhausted.
If it's the latter, then changing that fact could just be a matter of adjusting how you use a certain app or who you follow.

After cutting out social media I noticed a couple things change. First of all I was getting better sleep because I wasn't using my phone for hours while in bed.
Secondly, I noticed myself becoming truly bored for the first time in a long time (probably since I got a smart phone). I don't see this as a bad thing though.
Doing hard things usually requires overcoming some inertia, and I've found that a little bit of boredom often does the trick. So when I would start to get bored, without
the option of browsing reddit for two hours I would do something else like practice guitar or cook. And afterwards I would feel satisfied and energized,
instead of guilty about not being productive.

Unfortunately while it's helped a lot, quitting social media hasn't turned out to be the silver bullet of time management. The temptation still exists to turn off my brain
and spend hours at a time in a state of neither relaxation nor productivity. One thing I'm doing to help ensure this doesn't happen is keeping a tracking document of different weekly goals I've set for myself (finishing a book, running X miles, etc.). I've decided I'm going to keep updating this document for 10 weeks and afterwards reflect on
if I felt this approach helped me use my time better and make progress towards larger goals, and if it affected my happiness in a negative or positive way.

If you've read this far and my thoughts and feelings are resonating with you, I would suggest doing some thinking of your own on these topics. I don't believe in
giving up on social media because you've been told enough times that it's Bad, and I also don't believe in any unhealthy desire to be maximally productive at all times.
But if you feel that your pursuit of things you find fulfilling is starved by browsing news feeds, then going on a permanent social media diet could be part of the solution.
