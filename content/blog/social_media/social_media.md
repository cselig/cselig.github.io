title: Social Media Bad >:(

excerpt: My thought process behind why I recently gave up on social media apps.

A few Sundays ago I was sitting at my desk and thinking about all the things I wanted to do in the coming week.
The list included: trying out a new recipe, brainstorming and recording new song ideas for my band,
fiddling around with my personal website, finishing that book that I've been halfway through for 3 months, etc.
I wasn't guilt tripping myself into being productive, rather I was looking forward to every item on my list because they were all things I really enjoy doing and find fulfilling.
I then had a realization: this list sounded a lot like the list I had made last Sunday. And in the week between, I hadn't
really done anything that I intended. This definitely wasn't due to a lack of free time, because it was quarantine and I had
basically nothing going on. So over the next week I decided to take better stock of what I was filling my days with and noticed that a lot of my time was going toward one activity that I hadn't planned at all and didn't find especially enjoyable: browsing social media.

Before I continue I want to address a couple reasons why writing about social media feels like a touchy subject for me.
One of the reasons is that the argument (in the US at least) against using social media is beat to death to the point that
it feels there's very little new to say. Everyone knows that social media is bad for you, and everyone still uses it.

There are also some problematic aspects with the way that people talk about social media - one being that the language used is usually
negatively charged and filled with judgement. For example, I did a quick google search and came up with the following headlines:
- [Has social media become an endless nightmare?](https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/opinion/has-social-media-become-endless-nightmare-matt-mohan-hickson-2912439)
- [Doomscrolling Is Slowly Eroding Your Mental Health](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/)
- [Scrolling Is The New Smoking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianatsai/2020/06/25/scrolling-is-the-new-smoking/#6f6168a233ca)

While I actually don't really object to most of the arguments made in the above articles, I think when people see
a headline like the above it immediately gives them the opportunity to dismiss the author as alarmist, out of touch, or nagging.

Take a seemingly more neutral headline like [How much social media scrolling are you actually doing?](https://www.abc4.com/gtu/how-much-social-media-scrolling-are-you-actually-doing/).
This article starts with

> "When it comes to checking your social media, Americans are obsessed! Here are some fascinating facts we found."

and continues by listing some simple statistics on social media use in the US. While the article presents itself as an
unbiased presentation of facts, the lack of associated commentary means that readers will most likely
project their own assumptions that social media is necessarily bad and using it is necessarily unproductive without the author
even having to address or argue for those assumptions (which by the way seems like ultimate journalistic irresponsibility to me).
Even the kind of language used here reveals an implicit opinion - "obsessed" certainly,
but also the word "scrolling" in my mind comes with connotations of passivity and laziness.
If you need more convincing, just watch the video included in the article with these points in mind.

I say all this because I want to avoid these problematic issues of language and argumentation when I talk about my own hangups
with social media. One of these hangups is that I felt emotionally drained by my use of social media. I would see annoying patterns
emerge, like:
- on twitter, a preference for passive-aggression and irony over earnest discussion
- a hive mind mentality on reddit, where top posts and comments only reflect the majority opinion (whatever it is at the time)
- the fact that the most comments on a hacker news story are belligerently contrarian toward the article, and most replies to those
  comments are belligerently contrarian toward their parent comment, and so on.

Repeatedly observing and getting frustrated by these patterns was definitely making me more unhappy, even before I had been able
to articulate what I was noticing.

My use of social media was also very often distracting me from other tasks that required long periods of focus. This hurt my productivity
but it also hurt my enjoyment of my work and hobbies; I notice that when I'm deeply focused on an activity and and able to make good progress is when I feel
the most enjoyment and fulfillment from that activity.

But the main reason I decided to make a change goes back to me sitting in my room on a Sunday taking stock of what I had done in the past week and what I
intended to do in the next, and realizing that their was a large gulf between the two. **I wasn't finding time in my days to do things I enjoyed, and I decided that
using twitter/reddit/facebook/etc. was the cause.** I could choose to fill my free time with things I actively enjoy, find fulfilling, and that broaden my thinking
and my skills, or I could choose not to.

From there it was a simple decision to change how I used social media in order to make time for things I enjoyed. This took some reflecting on my
own personal access patterns. For example, I was really only in the habit of checking things on my phone (and not on my laptop), so deleting
a few mobile apps was sufficient to remove that temptation.

Of course trying **not** to do something is a lot harder than trying **to** do something, so I decided to focus more
on how I wanted to fill my time and less on avoiding browsing social media. There's an idea I had gotten from  Cal Newport's book Deep Work that I found useful
in scheduling my time: a human's daily capacity for deep focus and doing "hard" things is finite. For example, if I finished a full day of focused work,
immediately studied chess for 2 hours, and then spent my evening practicing cello, I would probably burn out pretty quickly. Not that any of these
are things I shouldn't use my time on, but I should in that case try to structure and schedule my activities in a smarter way.
For me, two activities I decided I want to do more of were reading and cooking. These form a relaxing compliment to my day job, and I have no problem
sitting on the couch and reading for an hour right after I finish my work day.

I do believe that social media can be used productively - this is all based on my own habits of use with these sites. I had a conversation with a friend who
uses reddit in a much different way than I did: he sticks to smaller, interest based subreddits where he's more likely to see novel content and less likely to get
emotionally burned out. I view this as an enriching and rewarding way to use reddit, and something I would consider in the future.
I also value checking facebook every once in a while. I have a large network of friends there that isn't captured anywhere else, and it's nice for me to stay
somewhat up to date with big events in people's lives.

I also recognize the irony and privilege in talking about turning away from social media when we're living through events
that we can't and shouldn't turn away from â€“ but I'll leave it up to you to determine if your social media feeds
leave you better informed and prepared to take positive action or just emotionally exhausted.
If it's the latter, then changing that fact could just be a matter of adjusting how you use a certain app or who you follow.

After cutting out social media I noticed a couple things change. First of all I was getting better sleep because I wasn't using my phone for hours while in bed.
Secondly, I noticed myself becoming truly bored for the first time in a long time (probably since I got a smart phone). I don't see this as a bad thing though.
Doing hard things usually requires overcoming some inertia, and I found that a little bit of boredom is often enough to overcome that inertia. So instead of
browsing reddit for two hours, I would do something else for two hours like practice guitar or cook. And at the end of those two hours I felt satisfied and energized,
instead of guilty about not being productive.

If you've read this far and my thoughts and feelings are resonating with you, I would suggest asking yourself a simple question like, "Do I enjoy how I use my time?".
If the answer is no then getting off social media might be the solution.

But I believe in doing it for the right reasons. Don't do it because you feel preached at, and don't do it for any unhealthy desire to be maximally productive at all times.

Do it for your own happiness.
