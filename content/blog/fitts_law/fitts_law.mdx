Fitts' Law is a mathematical model of human movement that was proposed in a 1954 paper by pyschology researcher
Paul Fitts. The law is now a commonly known principle in UX design, as it predicts the difficulty of users
clicking on certain UI elements.
The law expesses the time required to move a pointer to a target as a function of the distance
to the target and the size of the target:

**D** is the distance to the target, **W** is the size of the target, **T** is time, and **ID** is the
difficulty index of a specific movement to a target. The law predicts that time is a linear function of difficulty
index, which you can check for yourself by clicking on the circles below and building a plot of your data points.
