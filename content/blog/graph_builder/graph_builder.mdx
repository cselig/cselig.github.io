title: Connected Graph Components

In the process of making the "ski graph" component for [this post](/blog/ski-graphs) I built a graph editor so I could
easily lay out the nodes and edges. That editor is displayed separately here because it's neat, and I also implemented the algorithm
for computing the connected components of a graph with some visual flair.

See complete code [here](https://github.com/cselig/cselig.github.io/tree/develop/content/blog/graph_builder).

import GraphUIContainer from "./graph_ui_container"

<GraphUIContainer />
