I recently went skiing, and the process of studying the trail map and picking
out routes got me thinking about how a ski resort is basically a big directed graph.

This inspired me to make a little widget that would find shortest paths between two points in the resort. The result
is a simplified version of Heavenly that doesn't include the parts that were closed when I was there and
also doesn't include advanced terrain that I can't ski down (yet). The grey edges are the chairlifts, and the other edges
are the runs color-coded by level.

To find a path, click on a start and end node. You can check out the completed code
[here](https://github.com/cselig/cselig.github.io/blob/develop/content/blog/ski_graphs/ski_graph.jsx).


import SkiGraph from "./ski_graph"

<SkiGraph />
