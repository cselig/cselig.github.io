Ever wondered where your fingers spend the most time on a keyboard? Below you can see a heat map
showing the relative frequency of each letter on the keyboard (the frequencies are computed from the
text of Hamlet). The completed code is [here](https://github.com/cselig/cselig.github.io/blob/develop/content/blog/keyboard_frequencies).

You can toggle between the standard English Qwerty keyboard layout, the Dvorak layout,
and the Colemak layout (the latter is a layout that attempts to balance efficiency with similarity
to Qwerty).

If you want to type for yourself, click into the input field below the keyboard and you can
type along to a certain famous movie as the keyboard updates.

import Keyboard from './keyboard_ui_container'

<Keyboard />
