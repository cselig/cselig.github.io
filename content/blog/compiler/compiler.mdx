After taking [this](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers) online compilers class, I thought it would be
fun to build compiler for a simple language that displays output of some intermediate compiler phases.

## A Simple Calculator Language

The language I chose to implement is a very simple one that only supports functions (with parameters), if-then-else expressions,
addition, subtraction, and integer constants. The body of each function is a single expression.

## Parsing

The first step of the compiler is lexing and parsing which I implemented with [Jison](https://gerhobbelt.github.io/jison/docs/).
Jison and similar tools like Bison and Yacc require you to specify the grammar of your language.

A specification for the calculator language would look something like:
- A **program** is made of one or more **functions**
- Each **function** may have parameters, and has a single **expression** for the body
- An **expression** can be **addition**, subtraction, if-then-else, function invocation, parameter ID, or a constant.
- An **addition expression** has left-hand and right-hand side expressions.
- And so on...

Jison takes this specification and returns a parse tree.

## Static Analysis

Static analysis is run over the parse tree to ensure that the program follows some rules of the language.

The rules are:
- There should be one function named `Main` that takes no parameters
- Function names should be unique
- Parameter names for each function should be unique
- Functions should be invoked with the correct number of arguments
- All variables in a function should refer to one of the function's parameters

You can click on the example "Static Analysis Errors" below to see a program that breaks some of these rules.

## Code Generation

Code generation is the final step of this compiler and runs via a recursive descent of the parse tree.

Code generation targets the simple instruction set of [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture).
The following registers are used:
- `$a0`: the accumulator
- `$t1`: for temporary results
- `$sp`: the stack pointer
  - Address of next unallocated location on stack kept here
- `$fp`: the frame pointer
  - Pointer to currently active stack frame
- `$ra`: the return address

Evaluating an expression will always leave the stack unchanged and the result of the expression in
`$a0`, the accumulator register.
