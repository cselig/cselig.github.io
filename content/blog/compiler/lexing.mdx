I'm taking [this](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers) online compilers course right now and the class project is to build
a compiler for a simple object-oriented language, [COOL](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/27e1a38f1161e61d91c25a4b1805489b/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YCSCS1+3T2020+type@asset+block/cool_manual.pdf).
Instead of implementing the components in C++ or Java run the compiler from the command line, I thought it would be fun
to implement the compiler in Javascript and make it visual. Below you can type COOL code and examine the outputs of each
compiler stage.

## Lexing

The first stage of the compiler is to tokenize the input code and classify those tokens, which is called
lexing. This is the simplest step to implement and involves specifying regular expressions for each
token class in the language. You can type code below but lexing will not identify any errors except
for unidentified tokens; checking syntax and semantics is left for parsing and later stages.

import RootUIContainer from "./root_ui_container"

<RootUIContainer />

## Parsing

In progress.
