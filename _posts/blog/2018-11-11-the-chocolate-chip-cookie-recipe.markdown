I'm a staunch believer in a somewhat famous New York Times recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Following the [recipe][nyt-recipe] is fairly simple, but there are some specific tips I have after years of chasing the perfect chocolate chip cookie. <!--excerpt-->
Combine the recipe with these tips and like me, you might be able to convince your friends that you're a good baker.

## Where you can cut corners...

Generally the recipe as it stands is pretty fussy. In my opinion, you can get by with only using one type of flour (probably general purpose), instead of the two kinds called for in the original recipe. I also think that the amount of sugar can be cut down on, and that you can use salted butter if it means not taking an extra trip to the store. Of course, for best results you should try to follow the recipe closely if possible.

## ...and where you can't

The absolute most important element of this cookie is the kind of chocolate used. You want to get chocolate disks which are usually used for melting and creating chocolate sauces. **Don't mess this up!** - using chocolate chips just won't achieve the desired result. You're looking for the finished product to have little pools of melted chocolate, and the shape of these disks makes them perfect for this purpose. You can usually find these disks in any bulk food section, but my favorite type is the Ghirardelli dark chocolate melting disks.

For one batch of this recipe you'll need two of these 10oz packages.

For the sea salt, there's no reason to scrimp; generally the fancier and more Icelandic, the better. Also don't forget to chill the dough. Leaving it overnight in the fridge really makes the texture.

## Baking to perfection

You should pull these cookies out of the oven right when the edges start to brown and can be lifted up with a spatula. You should try to err on the side of leaving them undercooked, as cookies always tend to cook more than you expect out of the oven as they cool.

Again, you can find the recipe [here][nyt-recipe]. I think these cookies are absolutely worth the extra time and effort required, and hopefully after your first batch you'll agree!
