I'm using some of my "shelter in place" free time to learn D3 and create some toy visualizations.

<!--excerpt-->

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
<script src="//d3js.org/d3-scale-chromatic.v0.3.min.js"></script>

<style>
/* scrollable code */
pre {
  height: 75vh;
}
</style>

### Some sort of bubble chart

I'm not sure what this chart would be called, but something like this could be used for visualizing a single variable.

<div id="bubble-chart" style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin:20px;">
  <svg width="200" height="200"></svg>
</div>

<script>
// extra curly braces for scoping variables
{ {% include blog/d3_vizs/bubble_chart.js %} }
</script>

```js
{% include blog/d3_vizs/bubble_chart.js %}
```

### Volume Calendar

My take on a nice Strava visualization that shows how much you ran/biked/swam on given days over the past month, along with a weekly aggregation.
The original version displays the calendar day on hover, which I think could be easy to confuse with distance ran on that day.

<div id="volume-calendar" style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin:20px;">
  <svg width="500" height="200"></svg>
</div>

<script>
{ {% include blog/d3_vizs/volume_calendar.js %} }
</script>

```js
{% include blog/d3_vizs/volume_calendar.js %}
```
